# TEA_Lang_Core
## Welcome to the TEA_Lang_Core project page!

The TEA_Lang_Core was our project presented as a requisite for the ICOM 4036 Programming Languages course offered by professor Wilson Rivera at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus. The TEA development team consist of Enddy Y. Gonzales, Jonathan A. Román and Enrique J. Vargas

The "Terminal Enhancement App" (TEA) is a programming language designed to streamline the communication with command terminals and to simplify the creation of scripts. It mix coding style of well-known languages like C or Java with simple terminal commands to make simple, legible code. Native features of the TEA language include communication with the system terminal application using synchronous command executions, built-in terminal commands (for example, creating a directory) and a PATH management class for files and directories.

Our motivation was the difficulties presented when communicating with the Main Terminal. The use of command terminals has several benefits over using a graphical application, including that command terminals are fully scriptable and, in most of the cases, faster.  Also there are tasks on computers where the command terminal is the most suitable option, such as advanced administrative functions and troubleshooting certain kinds of OS issues at a low-level. However, working with the command terminal to perform tasks or processes that are repetitive and long quickly becomes hard and tiresome and therefore prone to human errors.  The use of command line scripts such a batch or bash ease those issues, yet the commands used on command terminal are not exactly human-readable, making such scripts hard to understand and sometimes looking like messy spaghetti code, virtually illegible to humans.

Our approach was to follow the JAVA programming style. Strictly speaking, currently TEA looks like a library for JAVA than a programming language. You can write code in TEA and the TEA translator convert the code into JAVA code.
